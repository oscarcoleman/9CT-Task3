- Visualise data in a bar graph, with primary school and high school data per country side-by-side, one red and one blue.
### Non-Functional

## Research
### SEE-I Paragraph
In some countries of the world, such as India, research indicates that school profiency is on the decline as students progress from primary school to the end of high school. As shown in a recent Indian government survey, relative student performace in both literacy and mathematics has been shown to fall by a few percentage points from Class 3 to Class 6 and Class 6 to 9. Most dramatically of all, however, it is to be seen that while 53% of Class 6 students knew times tables up to ten, only 28% could solve problems related to percentages by Class 9. On the whole, this is not a promising indication toward the effectiveness of continuous academic pursuits and deserves consideration.
